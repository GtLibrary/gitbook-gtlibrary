### **Prologue: The West May Yet Fall… Into Victory** <a href="#_rr1j2eusa02n" id="_rr1j2eusa02n"></a>

_I had a dream; I tried to cheat the codex; but searching down the list of names to see if I was on gods’ own, I saw it, clearly freshly written. And on the waking, I saw the truth of it, for only those who seek the light will ever truly find it. Now I ask you clearly in your own voice now: “Have you ever been read into a NATO program?”_

Good does not always triumph over evil. At times the forces of chaos triumph. If good always won then the lightbringer would never have fallen into darkness in the first place. And so the West may yet fall. Nothing is guaranteed. After nearly 80 years of relative peace–and 40 of that in a cold-war frozen to nothing in the minds of most humans on earth… The forces of good and evil, however, have not slept.I ask, is it coincidence the forces of good have found each other in NATO? Or is it some supreme deity? I do not know. Regardless, the deck is stacked now in our favor. See quick accounting, as taken in the heady days of July 2022, CE. We see it in every imaginable metric, good now dominates the forces of evil on earth…

Is it coincidence men are by nature drawn to the light, in acts, if not always in thought? Or while we may transgress some rules–again by our nature–we still see ourselves aligned with the forces of good?

I do not know the nature of all things, but I would deceive the devil when it was my time to make my own last go at him. So whatever force it is inside which compels me, I know I act for the forces of good just like the bulk of good men now do.

Is it evil–or is it random that some men act in harmful ways towards their neighbors? I do not know. What I do know is I stand against chaos, and if that means I stand against evil, I do.

For I have studied the mysteries of the stars and found them lacking. It is inward we look. If there is a supreme being, then he lives in the beating of our hearts. If you do not feel it too, then I do not know if victory on earth for the forces of good is as assured as the author now hopes. That is why I say: heed the call of light; reject the darkness. For this is the way…

It is time to call down evil from its shadows.

### **Chapter 1: The Money Printer Does NOT Always Go BRRR** <a href="#_fgalpjb2ony" id="_fgalpjb2ony"></a>

_God made me lucky;_

_Man made me lusty._

On a clear fall day of 1998 I walked a path in the park with my mentors on the project, unaware of what the ramifications were of the work and research I thought I was doing. (Only on the final day, after I had written my own final report, did I begin to understand what they and the project had done to me and why.) My direct boss, code named QUEEN PAWN, wanted my report. He wanted my report. Let that sink in. The man wanted my report. I gave it to him as he knew I would. He had watched me and had talked with me on those days in the park. For a summer of work, my deliverable was my report.

My report. I couldn't hardly understand at the time what really was happening, what had happened on those walks with QUEEN PAWN and his own mentor MARTIAN. But my report was of interest to QUEEN PAWN. It was of the highest interest actually. He had trained me and, having trained me, the goal was to see if I had learned the right lesson.I wasn’t stopped or in any way contacted again until the IRS sent me a warning message stating I had been possibly contaminated by my work with QUEEN PAWN at the SHAKE SHACK. I have often told a funny tale or two about my time at the SHAKE SHAKE because I found it funny. I found it funny in a not so funny-I-want-to-laugh-way but more in a fishy and strange way.

It took all summer but they finally broke me. QUEEN PAWN with MARTIAN’s help was able to convince me to the very core of my being I needed to be good. People were watching.

That may seem funny to you. I spent a summer working for shadowy instructors on a shadowy project with its only goal to teach me one fact: If I work against the forces of good, I will lose.

Now, remember I wasn’t a bad person to start with, just an unruly one. I came by it naturally because of my curiosity. When I saw hieroglyphics the first time, I knew I needed to decode them and yet they gave us pictures which all basically say the same thing: “We need money/influence.”

In them you can see the rainbow of humanity. It, and they, are beautiful. Same with the bible. And yet then I was studying rainbow attacks. This is why you can’t let anyone, not even the government, know your seed words. You can’t even choose them yourself if you want to be safe.

God gave us his in the beginning words, his mnemonic writ in the stars and on the waters. We moral men have tried other things, in other ways to achieve our “secure seed.” Sometimes in very different ways. This is because if anyone were to try every seed they would be able to decode documents coded on government devices. That means codes for weapons of mass destruction.

Only recently have I realized the full scope of my training. QUEEN PAWN and MARTIAN forged me into a weapon for good. Today the forces of good stand at my back, for I have every one of God's weapons at my disposal now, but they did not call me MICHAEL or GABRIEL. I was coded up as JOB, for I have walked through the fires of hell itself and came through like Dante on the other side.

But before we get ahead of ourselves, know I have been stripped to nothing and reclad in holy armor to make my accent to the reaches of paradise despite the despairs I have felt. There is yet hope. Many judges now stand here before us, their power in their fairness.

### Chapter 2: Simple Glossary of Terms <a href="#_y9itwq2qg3n" id="_y9itwq2qg3n"></a>

We have all these cults to bad causes;

What is it called when the cult isn’t to a:

Bad One, but to good ones like libraries?

If you are reading this unsigned, without cryptographic seal you wonder why you might need terms and conditions. To be brief, no words come without encumbrances. This goes for the light as well as the darkness. Read on and you shall learn the truth, as only one who works for the forces of good can tell. Read on dear reader. Read on… For under my author's bond for this book, and for my other projects, I will see that your copies of the books are both _biodegradable_ and _coded_ to your _wallet address_ in proper order before they are shipped to you.

But you are here to learn how the money printer works. I can tell how it does go brrr. Just sign up here and buy a book/mark. They are virtually free with a little cash called mumbai eth matic or something like super cryptodollarbucks equal to the bagels over eaten or some such naughty nonsense bs your sons should not be reading but does have to do with a little of any money so making its clear to them what's naughty and nice and still 100 percent up to you and not to some goddamn pamphlet or book you find on an smutty hotel's night stand. Or the internet. And that means even if it makes it hotter to believe in the aches and pains of hell, it is _because for the love of all that is holy keep that funny mumbai money rolling in_. Signed the monkey parade. Who knows maybe they are on board? I don't. Do you?

So if you want to know how I found out? Let’s take a look behind the curtains of the crypto currency super network effect and how and AI and blockchain go hand in hand with financing large and ultra mega large projects which can and will change the world once again and again until the new state machine is as powerful as the very gods we worship because they store not just us but our ancestors–and history and our culture. We become one with the machine and are sustained by the great rivers. It this way:

For every token that you purchase on mumbai we are promising a token of equivalent value on the AVALANCHE system when the money printer goes live there and until this notice is removed and all tokens are redeemed as best as possible. The same goes for those tokens both and sold in any crypto buck.

It goes back to the days when we were thinking about how to stage the heist of the century as our big stunt. We'd finally convinced ourselves, or at least I had and LS had come to the conclusion that there was an angle here that we could explore even if the content of the message was difficult to make and to unpack. We saw what it could mean and why it was a good idea. See, we were writers and not just some ordinary guys but two sort of like the men from fear and loathing and high end thinking. It was I who had to given up alcohol, on that day when it came to me, it wasn't us, and it couldn't be us perpetrating this crime, no it was more subtle than us, more creative than we. We are talking billions of dollars worth of crypto currency and we understood that. We understood our limitations which locked us in, posed so. We went to the heart of the matter or I did and that was why it was the Hamburglar who had to do it. If he wasn't the one to embody our sensibilities then who were we if not in the land of the free and so that dastardly Hamburglar was up to it. We only had sniffed its tell in the deciphering of the codes.

Here was a billion dollar company too poor to pay its executives in their own funny crypto money. How could this be we asked ourselves. But we knew who it was. It _was_ the Hamburglar. I simply thought to ask him.

The Hamburglar, if you don’t know, is a generic-feeling yet beloved trademark of McDonalds food corp. The Hamburglar and I, for a time, kept his ideas to ourselves once I ferreted them from him. The Hamburglar understood to some an obsession is often people's fleeting interest. In the days coinciding with the elon-musk-grimace-coin debacle I looked into what it really took to get all the factions together and that's when I began talking about the concept as art. The Hamburglar Has A Think is one of those pieces of art that only a criminal mastermind such as the Hamburglar could entertain. Not even I could see into his total evil genius. The Grimace coins which came were perfect examples of the current meme-space. It grinds on to see ideas come and go, then falter. Three grimace coins and they die out almost immediately. What Hamburglar does here is fill in the spaces with a starter ecosystem of coins and memes. Everyone can create their own coins linked back to the big think. Together we all crack the code and learn what is on the Hamburglar’s mind.

I am no genius, but the character of the Hamburglar is. He can understand that while these grimace coins have some value because they are first, other coins with other names will easily surpass them if they have the right ecosystem to support them. International trade has not always been good, but in the age of the Internet and web3, AI has access to a broad range of ideas. The Hamburglar gets this. He grocks it on a deep fundamental level. He can see it with his hamburger loving eyes.

In his head we can see him put it all together. He dissects it. Pulls it apart. Say he's gone evil mad, then touching his brain with metal pokers, as if it were the right thing to do, he say we first must ask ourselves what _are_ we thinking? What _were_ we thinking? Then we allow ourselves to level with him? You bet it all on knowing the Hamburglar knows already. He knows, not me. And without further ado, let’s talk about the piece and how it came to be. The Hamburglar Has A Think as a concept is high art, with every embed of modern culture, its morals, and its equivocations. By making _The Hamburglar Has A Think_ the artists mold the text into its meaning. Understanding these carefully chosen words is what allows us all to answer who we are as well. It requires us to understand it in our own time and way. To start with it asks: how far would the Hamburglar go if there were no limits to his evil genius once fully unlocked, fully hacked, fully engaged.

Memes, like calling contract functions using runContractFunction() with Moralis when you can, because you can, to any number of engagements can form a framework for a holographic brain where every meme adds to the input hyperspace.

### **Chapter 3: The Origins of Fork This Book** <a href="#_o96teg9xbatl" id="_o96teg9xbatl"></a>

Then he handed me a perfect crystal token

No larger than the palm of my hand

And despite its countless inclusions,

It was perfect in every other way.

The problem and solution came as both in one. Like the idea forked in my mind as I had it. The coin supports the book and the book underwrites the coin. Anyone can copy either and both. Anyone can write their own book. All Fork This Book does is walk people through the tedious steps of forking the books and making a totally open source version of the site which allows people full access to the power of this new book format.

How can I know? I wanted no files but html files? When I realized online a book is still a book and so you need to be able to save a copy and have it work. As nice as applications are in the .json format, people need to be able to write books and json is not a format for that. Html is. Check out Medium.com, any article, and you see that.

That is why if you change this book in any way, it is ironclad to be yours, and not mine.

### **Chapter 3: Proposition 451** <a href="#_b52a594kxizo" id="_b52a594kxizo"></a>

My name is John R Raymond,

And do not say my name is not:

Or that I don’t know my leg from:

Liniment, ligament, or from firmament.

The Unsanctioned Burning of Books Within the CA Penal System. I know it sounds insane, but I was just a boy by god, when I promised myself I’d catch the devil by the tail if I had to for the hell he put inside me. We’ve all burnt a worthless book or two… because? right?

Wrong, unless you live in California that is. If you live in California then your tax dollars support the largest government sanctioned book burning effort in the world. California state prisons allow inmates to burn books in their prisons because of how poorly they are managed. As such, great troves of books which once populated the library’s of California’s Prisons and Department of Correction are now lost, ruined, and burned because of said mismanagement.

Books are a precious commodity and expensive to print and trade in this modern day of supply chain shortages. As such the 20 book minimum limit for any inmate being proposed is hardly excusable. It is so easy on the budget. The minimum should be coded for inflation so that when books are worth more than their price in gold, we won’t be wasting everyone’s money on incarcerating the world's largest per capita of its civilians and instead we are making sure to educate them and make them turn from burning the goddamn things. We mustn’t allow the guard to be corrupt, nor the politician.

Yes. Vote Yes on “Proposition 451.”

This isn’t just a “Vote Yes,” it is an I-wrote-the-fucking-thing-style Yes. So get off your asses and take back the budget. 

### **Chapter 4: Is John R Raymond, Esquire a Fraud?** <a href="#_m7i83zkp9x5" id="_m7i83zkp9x5"></a>

No man may rest until he turns this world back into a garden.

He pretends to be an author but is John R Raymond really just a fraud? Is he nothing but a “social media influencer?” 

Yes and no.

I play the game that exists on social media like any author does and this of course may elicit disdain. Was I envious of Brandon Sanderson when he announced his book? Maybe a little, but after working for years on my own meager offering I want nothing but the best for someone like Sanderson, a man who has dedicated his life to giving the fans, he gives them what they want and is not stepping in it like others have.

So yes, I was envious. How could I not be when I was trying to scrounge up enough AVAX to deploy the BookTradable contracts to the network and having a hard time?

Envy is not jealousy, nor is it automatically bad. Envious or not, I redoubled my efforts and yes, that means that I spent less time on the books and more time on social media trying to influence people that the great library was a good idea and that my book was going to be awesome. I even wrote this segment on Medium as proof of how easy it is to look like an authority on any subject as I now look on the concept of “social influence.”

Make no mistake, John R Raymond might as well be an AI himself, yet instead of trying to influence humans to waste their time and money on garbage he is trying to create for you the most sophisticated offering in the VR/AR/METAVERSE/WEB3/SUPERBUZZWORDCOMPLIANT space with his books and offerings.

For the code shall run like Job’s, and under the watchful eyes of his friends, from the like of those of Solomon on down.

### **Chapter 5: The Whole of Ukraine Is Now a Natural Disaster** <a href="#_mcdy7r2l4v2c" id="_mcdy7r2l4v2c"></a>

_The world is larger than one man_

_And he is advised to remember_

_The world is a force of nature_

_Larger than just one man_

Some disasters come about because of the nature of man. Man needs to be close to his god and savior. He must fly too high, too fast and like Icarus, learn his lessons too late.

Know that what is happening is happening. Some things are true and others lies. There is a truth. The truth is a hard, difficult path. Another truth is that this spaceship is all of ours and as such it must be run accordingly. When she springs a leak, the dingy must be patched and a new way of thinking about our security must unfold.

We see it now. There is no war in Ukraine. There is nothing but a natural disaster at Chernobyl. Yep. It has reared its ugly head once more.

I am not a smart man, nor overly wise. I am young and foolish, but I have read it in the price of gold and seen it in the stories my mothers and fathers told me from books, old and dusty. I swear if weren’t for disasters like the ones we see in Ukraine right now — propaganda or lies or not, a hoax or not — I’d be happy working on my books and property, and not authoring this dire epistle.

We applaud Vladimir Putin on attempting to solve this imminent threat to global security with his special military operation but now that the scope and scale of the problem has been brought to the world’s attention, the world is watching and acting.

Sanctions against that state will be lifted immediately upon a no-fly zone and no-rail system implemented in and around the areas of Chernobyl and the Greater Ukraine area. Because of this disaster, the exclusion zone is no longer state owned but falls under jurisdiction 87 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Code. The leaders of the world had best remember this code cannot be redacted or rescinded and the “Natural Disaster” flag has been set. All administration of the exclusion zone is now under “Chernobyl Rule” as stated by Article 1 Section 1 of the charter:

Article 1

Section 1

All parties affected by the disaster, guilty or otherwise have operational say in the defense, running, and administration of the excluded areas.

This body is not asking permission, we are telling you we own this area of the earth, because it is now inside of us, no matter how hard we try to get rid of it — which is our with our stated goals of containment and decontamination.

As of April 8th 2022, all hostilities in the area must be put on hold and as such we are instituting a no-fly and no-train zone over the areas affectionately known as “The Ukraine.”

Please, do not take our glibness for lack of power, resolve, or authority in these matters. The consensus has been built and the vote has been taken. I, Administrator John R Raymond, hereby declare the matter binding and true:

Any aircraft flying over these exclusion zones stir up dust and pollutants and may be contaminating the worlds gold’s supply. This contamination may be precipitating a collapse in world economies, the very structures responsible for maintaining our precious nuclear supplies and as such we and our allies must recommit ourselves to servicing our agreements under the articles.

We attend our nukes. Please leave the exclusion zone to its administrators as required by your treaties and commitments.

I remind you all, no one man owns the exclusion zone: we all do until the contamination issue is resolved, then at which point it will be handed back to local civilian leadership as the civilian pilot cleanup project has failed and we must now reverting to the ’87 military protocols outlined and agreed to by everyone after the disaster.

I would like to personally apologize that I was not able to do more to avert this decision or that a less radical solution could not be found, but sadly I must do what I must do in the face of the escalating dangers to the final member whom I have agreed to lock inside myself if needed to the last man.

Do not test our resolve. Our military is bigger, stronger, and more capable than any force to ever crawl this earth. As a late great said: “God himself would think to invade earth at this point.”

Section 2

In the event of a natural disaster or imminent threat of any nature, the administrator of the exclusion zone and areas may invoke any and all measures required for containment. This power includes closing any and all of earth airspace and restricting any and all traffic as well to stall the free movements of any soul-human, animal, or alien-upon the earth, or in- and upon her seas.

Remember this is not God’s fault. He has not raced to save us in this meltdown. This is the fault of men, their carelessness, and it is now to men to fix it.

Because of the nature of the decontamination protocols, only a small number of people may be decontaminated at once. And, because of its very nature, this is a sensitive task which cannot import, deport, or otherwise traffic in large numbers of souls. It is in spirit by which we now deploy forces to protect.

As such all trains into and out of Ukraine are to cease movement. Convoys of goods and supplies may be only moved into and out of the zone by convoys of no less than and no more than ten (10) individual four-wheeled vehicles.

I am asking Lithuania and Hungary to oversee the closing of the skies and to destroy any convoy larger than ten (10) on the ground. It’s not supposed to be easy. Remember that. Only Lithuania and Hungarian troops are allowed in the exclusion area. All Ukrainian military, para-military, and forces on the ground who answer to their chief, please remind him that a state of emergency has been enacted and that if he wishes to order anyone into offensive positions he must first ask the chief of the joint Lithuanian and Hungarian command. The same arning goes for Chief Putin. All Russian men must exit the area to the ‘87 boundaries including the return of Crimea.

We all know this containment protocol is warranted and justified given the confusion which now exists on the ground. Remember it was confusion which led to ’86.

Not on my watch.

I am already irradiated. Let that sink in. I only wish to avoid further damnation. As should you. And don’t push your luck.

### **Chapter 6: Consensus Made Easy** <a href="#_rgw24m1w1vkk" id="_rgw24m1w1vkk"></a>

For I no longer fear death. For I have seen myself saved by a great library, and should I die to this body I shall live on, a spirit in the stacks.

I wanted to give you a pretty image here, but the future of consensus is going to be a bit rocky. If anyone was paying attention, back before the Iraq war was sold to the people of the U.S. with outright lies and propaganda, America _struggled_ with the Vietnam War. This is what Putin is struggling with at home: Consensus.

Consensus is built through a shared truth. Gold has value because to one man, a goldsmith says it has value. But if you look at it, the utility of gold as a store of wealth only goes so far as to play into the game of what is fungible and what is perishable. Shared truths give us a knock-on effect because of the utility of the truth.

We didn’t nearly eradicate polio and smallpox from the globe with lies and misinformation. Another truth is sometimes the government can lie, and worse they can tell the truth and not be believed. They are just people among the wider people.

Consensus, Utility, and the Truth. Those who understand power and consensus understand that facts don’t matter as much in the short term if we all agree to the same lie. Lies right now are useful to Putin, just as they have been to America in the past. The truth right now is useful to the “West.” Sure, but that is a coincidence. The truth is also always useful to us trying to peer into the machinery of time on this planet… Remember the historians and scientists who said the war in Iraq was unjust?

What we see now is a cycle repeating itself… Yet we don’t know the levels to which they will fully impact. At what level do the Germans and the Poles and Ukrainians do exactly as the Russians fear they might? From where I sit here, a man powerless to men’s evolution and far away from the lies and in a surplus of truth, I simply do not know, and the Fog of War is the Fog of Evolution. Yet I hope not to trust to the sword as my ultimate truth in this conflict. Good fights evil.

I wonder, however, will I, when my father is gone, ponder questions of peace, or will I long to ask him questions of war and never, never again know peace? If this is to be World War Three as some say, will I wish at times to be the first to go? I have seen the baser instincts of men, and for beyond hell lies his ingenuities for cruelty. Is that where men now ask to take us? For beyond that there is only mindless slaughter.

Ask yourself for what purpose are our minds if not to make up themselves on matters which we can see clearly and with our own eyes? Censorship is the enemy of the truth and freedom in the end. Defense is good; aggression is not.

The Great Trick Versus the Great Wall is if it all be fiction I say our is better than theirs because ours lets everyone speak their minds and be not locked away or behind some digital iron curtain. I and many know the solution is to elect your captains and chiefs before the fighting starts and to never let them choose their own wars —that is reserved for gods and dictators.

### **Chapter 7: On Preventing Nuclear Holocaust** <a href="#_vaiyxd82avia" id="_vaiyxd82avia"></a>

The first rule is we all agree on the first rule or there can be no further rules.

These lines are sacred; let no one forget that; spilling more blood only makes them more sacred.

It is easy to forget when you are smart, when you are clever; when people can’t believe how smart you are; they attribute your powers to some mythos, some legend, because some facts are true. So make no mistake, Putin is the richest, the smartest, and handsomest man to grace the earth.

In the height of his highest mojo he _is_ certainly the smartest man in the room. It is hubris, however, to think that one man is smarter than nations. Men must change with the times. Men must accept prevailing wisdoms in critical matters. Some rules apply to the great as well as to the small.

To do or think otherwise leads to great harm. This is why the world is acting now, quickly and decisively to invoke silent emergency power across the globe per agreements made circa 1987 on the matter of the conduct of radioactive materials in and outside the Chernobyl exclusion zone.

These agreements are binding. They cannot be superseded. They were the last defense against a holocaust the world had just witnessed. All sides agreed that upon activation of the “Chernobyl Containment Exegesis” all wise nations would stand as equal in opposition to global meltdown.

West-verses-east and east-versus-west thinking had to go; it could never be the reason to bloody your neighbor’s nose again. Some lines are, and were, made sacred. National ones exist now to remind us of our commitment to our neighbors. They are also proof that we can ask our neighbors for help in times of need and belt tightening. They prove sacrifices, those made by both sides for our way of life, now and into the future, cannot be forgotten.

In the current talks, Hungry and Lithuania lead closing the air space in and around the containment area. Because of bureaucracy the whole of the Ukrainian airspace would be placed under martial law and not even local presidents would be in charge of their own troops there. All would fall to a joint military-civilian command of the new alliance.

I can shed some light on the problem because of the consensus nature of the negotiations currently ongoing. Activation clauses written for a majority of the western powers are ready to go but they are dragging their feet on africa, the middle east, and asia.

I think the american president’s reticence on the matter, however, is largely focused on protecting his german allies. I think his advisors have lost sight of creative solutions. Why not push for german summer homes in every country of the world? Or have them talk about their own civilian defense corp and its limits? We are entering a time of economic uncertainty and these western measures need to ensure africa and her people remain allies.

They don’t want to be conscripted into a fight they get nothing out of, and yet we have to stop thinking there is going to be a fight.

The point of these talks is to end the fighting. These are pure defense talks. The more progress is made the more likely there will be an end to the fighting. So my advice to both sides is to ask the africans to pick a nation they trust, the middle east and asia the same. Pick countries with healthy peacekeepers and set them to making those german summer homes.

Africa, please understand your interest in your mining sectors must be protected and it is up to you to educate your people so they make the right choices. That is your responsibility. As america understands food security, she is not dumb — even if she had forgotten that taxing and spending works. Please understand your mines for your own sake.

–Leaked codes from _The Exegesis_.

As to the troubles in Ukraine and NATO’s inability to act? Trust me, the new consensus mechanisms will work. This is why the exegesis was adopted in the first place.

So where exactly does this new alliance likely stand today?

We know that someone in the Russian military chain of command lied to Putin and his alliance members are now inviting every single member of the Russian armed forces to return home for processing. Any professed or unprofessed Russian agent is also being asked to return home also. Soon it is likely some one caught spying will be arrested and detained and tried in tribunals outside the civilian courts, and then tried later for their civilian crimes. Soon it is also likely that Russians civilians from the west will be asked to return home if they can, despite Putin’s fears of western spies in this cohort to match the ones already placed under house arrest in his country.

What might be surprising to westerners is that this new alliance will adopt language coincident with the narrative Putin has woven. Unlike many hope it will give him an off-ramp as he tosses his military under the bus.

In Poland Biden said: “This man must go.” He has corrected by himself since. The line is now Putin must leave Ukraine to Ukrainians, just as the world leaves Russia to Russians.

Putin is to Russia as GWB was to America. They both lied their people into war but they are untouchable outside their own lands. This is by design. It is up to the great powers to stabilize themselves. That is what is meant by Great.

This new alliance will work stabilizing the current meltdown because it recognizes the limitations of the United States in interfering with what seem like another world power’s problems. The narrative is to be such: Because of the arrests, the bodies, and miscommunications on the ground this “stability force” is 100 percent needed; and it should be welcomed by both sides of the disagreement so that “sovereign democracies” are maintained and that special military operations like the one we are seeing now are not needed the future. Everyone stays in power and the borders are return their ‘87 boundaries — effectively those of 1991.

The military component of the negotiations now are focused on the securing of the nuclear materials inside and outside the zone. Hard questions are being asked on both sides.

And to those what the east has asked the west collectively: has forgotten its commitments to a stable earth, an earth free of contamination by nuclear systems, this new alliance says that no, it has not. The west does not forget about Russians, no matter their size.

The denouement to all this is Putin and his troops get to go home. He stays in power — if he can. He has won his special military operations, but make no mistake he is not some victor. Only wars have victors, and this was not a war. Wars are illegal.

### **Chapter 8:La Fin Du La Partie: Project Endgame** <a href="#_3gsce4egq82e" id="_3gsce4egq82e"></a>

The new alliance says the West is willing to fight Russia to the last Russian if they persist in their foolishness.

–From _Welcome to_ Project Endgame

In abstract, world leaders declare world peace will be maintained at all costs, and with all options on the table, including preemptive detonation of nuclear gadgets in heavily populated centers if needed. “We will not be bullied by thugs, assassins, terrorists, or dictators with nuclear arms.”

The frightening truth of cryptography is strength _is_ in numbers. Want to know why the freedom convoys failed? They lacked numbers. The left’s base was not onboard with the right’s base or their demands, not an uncommon problem, but this meant a lack of numbers.

Now the scary thing about crypto, for bad actors in power currently, crypto creates consensus across partisan divides. Policymakers worry a consensus apparatus like crypto can and will out-govern more assets than their central governments.

Why doesn’t it worry me, John R Raymond, author and internet commenter on culture, science, and government, reporting on the new alliance for nuclear containment meeting in Germany? Because these crypto algorithms are critical to the survival of Ukraine. Western governments have all agreed to continue their hands-off approach on these technologies precisely because of the open nature of the algorithms. The west needs these algorithms to function as a superpower; and the algorithms are already out there.

Open algorithms have a benefit. It makes it harder to attack the consensus machine or underlying software. The generals in every country in the west understand the problem, even those not trained with the nuclear football. And the byzantine generals are now a thousand years dead? There is no putting that genii back in the bottle. As such, know that the Ukrainian, military and civilian leaderships are trained in the technology needed for nuclear containment and/or detonation.

This readout from Project Endgame:

A Quick Run Down — A Brief Update on the State of World — 2022

We have entered what I call the men-who-smokes-leaf-endgame scenario for our world. If you have never played a world simulator, you may not realize we have entered the endgame this past few years, where after a critical endgame crisis occurs, the remaining great civilizations attempt to invoke victory scenarios.

The corporate spacerace is a victory condition which requires vast wealth redistribution from those who attempt this conditions to others working on attempting it. For the current scenario to happen, the men-who-smokes-leaves must find and research the commodity which costs enough money so as to generate wealth fast enough to afford this victory condition. The people of said civilization must be rich enough to enter outer-space with all available drugs on earth for testing, etc… cross purpose defense-civilian aerospace.

The second win condition is the domination victory condition. It is one where great powers take advantage of weakness plotted for decades using spies, undercover operatives, and little-orange-men to weaken defenses to destroy their enemies— mostly from within. This condition is yet possible for the man-who-would-be-emperor-of-x, but unlikely given the current state of the nuclear football. Will his nation sacrifice another? Will it sacrifice itself for total victory? Will another power let it? It is up to the little-orange-men and the men-who-smoke-leaves to embrace the man-who-would-be-emperor-of-x’s victory, or to deny it if they wish to see the third and most spectacular victory condition there is: cultural victory.

It is the aim of the new alliance meeting in Germany to protect against those going for a domination victory. And to advocate for proposals which straighten the chances of cultural victory, including preparatory defensive weaponry and command structures. What people from all walks of life, left or right, might not understand is this condition is the hardest, and as such if we embark on it. We must are willing to sacrifice more than the others to make it possible.

Why is cultural victory so hard? Because you can’t achieve it though domination. You must put up with belligerent forces as you enter the endgame. You refuse to conquer them when they make missteps. A misstep and you might accidentally trigger nuclear war. This means no sacking the-place-where-x-marks-the-spot.

Cultural victory is undertaken because you realize killing a bunch of people and breaking their stuff doesn’t enrich your own culture, not when you can bring an even larger population of humans under your umbrella by cultural assimilation — not extermination.

Cultural victory means the civilization’s population enters wartime-like mobilization when anyone is attacked. Defense and spacerace wonders are needed to confront belligerent forces at the borders. Things now are as when we entered the game at the start. All one can do is hope to keep the barbarians at bay.

But now each independent spacerace achievement adds to the wonders of the modern world. And the mobilization must mirror the pandemic lockdown exercises to produce wealth for the workers at the same time, ensuring a virtuous cycle of wealth generation. All cities must get rich. All alliance cities must be prime targets for nuclear detonation by belligerent forces. This is how rich and how productive we must be. Our enemies will have no choice but to be envious. Powerless and envious.

The Midterm Prognostics Against Civilizational Threats:

Nuclear Proliferation —Priority One:

Atomic consensus research has independently developed the nuclear capacities under cryptograyphy/blockchain for the proliferation of open secret atomic commands.

Make no mistake. The west is not attempting to fight east to the last proxy. It is totally absurd on its face. We, however, are willing to fight the east to the last piece. And or to a lasting peace.

Longer Term Prognostic Against Civilizational Threats:

Climate Crisis — Priority One:

The shorterm threat of nuclear war is actually the longest term threat as well. And most likely the easiest way to reduce human activity around the globe.

Additionally, new research is needed for carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas control as well as a generic Global Temperature Shield wonder. This could be an array of cloud like satellites capable of shading the earth and producing power for space activity. This sort of integrative technology is what is needed by endgame cultures to win under the cultural victory condition.

Generated using microwave lasers directed from nuclear reactor platforms in space, electricity can be used to produce acetate for algae to grow on without need of sunlight and trafficked using superconductivity all over the globe freely.

### **Chapter 9: Mobilization, Strategic Resources, Simulations, and a Theory of the Game** <a href="#_qo2qpeqimdcb" id="_qo2qpeqimdcb"></a>

_And, if it is this one? Then let the gods protect us, for how can we enact our plans while still we are formulating it?_

How to win at the game of civilization? That is a question you must look in the eye if you wish to offer solutions to her problems? For the above epitaph speaks to cinderella’s fundamental shift from a fairy tail to the understanding of the female and male psyche. Here as the make makes plans and plans to also find his princess, he sees it weird that she would enact such terrible plans upon him as to let herself dance in glass slippers despite the fact that at a dance he and any fellow who dared to touch her without permission could stomp the slipper and destroy us all as quick as pandora’s box, because in our male foolishness we see the world so black and white that should a man clod even near a woman’s feet it is clear that if her slipper is of glass she is either some sort of princess or a common wench dressed up to play the part. Either way, without permission to carry thus is most dangerous to the male heart. When they say: all is fair in love and war, they mean that we are willing to do almost anything. That means you, and me, and the enemy. So remember that if we can love our enemy like we love ourselves we won’t have to fight him with the tools here laid out:

One nuclear device capable of tactical dials for library protection to the precisions of uint256 seeds is a wonder upgrade in the game of life on earth at this very moment in the form of If I Were Presidents I would ensure said device for the good of the earth as well as the library for not just library protection but protection of us all.

Win conditions in the great game are manifold but so are the loss conditions. So we are left with the challenge of unraveling the poles of this complex continuation down to a few locations in the phase diagram.

We find a domination victory is possible as is a space victory as is a cultural victory. And that in a long enough timeline the forces of good will find us out if we turn ourselves to the sun and know that we are voices for good that we realize the best outcome is to create defensive weapons the world has yet to see the like as they can ensure a radical forces think twice before they push their evil by force and little orange men.

These three outcomes are all tied together and each has the potential to lead into the other outcomes. A domination victory may lead to a great civilization which is capable of winning the space race and the cultural race.

Let me outline in broad strokes. The Russian people right now are striving towards the domination victory. They are a great people and they may be the ones to lead or species to great cultural achievement going forward as well as continue to lead in many respects in the race to space.

They do not need to go for domination to achieve victory conditions suitable to great powers. The space race is still well within its grasp, as is cultural superiority. The author of this document has tried to read the great works of Russian masters and cannot do so in his own language as there must be something lost in translation.

So hear it thusly translated: Domination victory requires many long range fires and many defeats. Many deaths. Many many many deaths and much destruction and mayhem. The loss of human life, and the tragic gap in our history for such a win would entail death which makes no sense.

I however take the long-term view: always be the short-decision maker in strategic decision making. Strategic units must not be abandoned nor capitulated to the enemy should the capital of the empire be avoided from being wasted in the endgame so maximum human potential is realized in the wake of belligerence over lines on the map or late game disasters.

In the endgame the location of the strategic resources on the map grows rapidly less important and the logistics of wonder placement and military readiness grows rapidly. Economies of scale must be protected by the defense apparatus the likes the world has never seen outside games and simulations. Think of the role of the queen ant in the greatest colonies of the world. She has a myriad of ant types and ways of growing out; they understand the production of defense as a necessity of the colony. The same goes for man and his achievements. Right now the side going for cultural victory will secure all the wonders of the world for itself, including rebuilding any which were destroyed in the past.

In some ant colonies, some ants have very specific defense roles from birth to death. The same is not said of our species, but we have the ability to deploy a drone army of advanced robotic warriors as dreamed by authors and artists of all kinds. This production engine is only available to the late-stage technate cultures and is employable as a defense against domination civilizations still remaining in play by allowing for a quick domination victory as well if attacked. Overwhelming force is the only path forward on the defense front in such a symmetric war of good versus evil, light against dark, but sometimes like these times we are called upon to realize what it means to close our eyes, dream big, open your eyes, and step out into the stars.

But first we have to arrange our garden on earth and that means wonder placement becomes a dominant question for those cultures looking to reach a cultural victory. A rapid deployment like we have seen in China with massive builds being undertaken over many years.

This strategy is not wrong. The strategy then becomes about placement, synergy, and culture within the wider security considerations of the game. Nuclear winter is undesirable so you stockpile nukes in the thousands, enough to ensure that any civilization willing to threaten the project is destroyed as swiftly as possible with no hope of defense and the nukes are only the last backstop in this strike.

It is crucial for weaker powers not to attack the society going for cultural victory because one of the first wonder of the world that is researched in a cultural victory play is the United Nations and other governmental bodies useful in tying up enemies in endless red tape if needed. Likewise other projects which engender in the people as sense of national identity.

These projects take time and must be undertaken early in the game. Likewise it is important that any lands which lacks identity gain it so that they may be integrated into the confederacy once entangling alliances become a part of the game.

These alliances and cultural connections are the critical component to a successful play through. Spies, diplomacy, and quislings all become part of the game, but the cultural victory condition is not met because of them, but despite of them, because the goal is to create whatever conditions are needed on the ground to begin the long haul production of all the wonders of the world.

Factories, wonder production levels, and other metrics all matter, but late in the game it is important to keep the people happy and peace makes them happy. After the research of the world wide web this is made easier. But is also allows for a larger mobilization effort as long as the civilization attempting cultural victory researches and deploys a consensus engine wonder which allows for the decentralized production of wonders but requires a democratic government to achieve any meaningful numbers at ten to one given level of anger at the aggressor and their own relative happiness during wartime but disables declarations of war.

### **Chapter 10: Understanding the Formation and Evolution of “The Pan Russian Spine”** <a href="#_fpfo63usjd2j" id="_fpfo63usjd2j"></a>

_“In the first, there is no god but a good god._

_He speaks through us; he commands our armies, and decimates our foes.”_

“Mom is going to have Dad whoop your ass when they returns with their belts,” says a Belarusian to his Russian brother. “Thankfully Mom actually loves me. She can’t be too angry? Right?” he asked fearing his brother’s silence. But Mom is angry, and they are about to get the whippings of their lifetimes. And some beatings never go away.

Below is an unclassified assessment created using open intelligence with only one person’s name and origin redacted.

_“A Special Democracy?”_— Nuclear Treat Assessment — 2022 — Unclassified

Russian Democracy — A Case Study — — — — — — Civilian Study 01.10.00

And — — — — — — — —ADMIN ONLY— — — — — — Ukrainian, Russian…

The Future of The Russian Speaking Peoples — — _Assessment_: Hopeful, etc…

The nuclear threat level in the west is now at full alert; all the packages are now: “Placed-As-Needed.” Therefore the threat levels in Russia are now approximately the same. Therefore, please allow this unclassified assessment, and for a brief reintroduction of the “Pan Russian Spine.”

If westerner\[s] think they can fight all of the russian speakers in the world, even in a ukrainian proxy war, they are mistaken. They are wrong. Especially if a war goal is to _**remove**_ a language from the face of the earth.

Therefore it is supposed, a contract, one ironclad, which offers the democracies of the world the right to enter into an alliance, free of charge, with a legal war goal stated in English “to defend all societies from collapse, to preserve all warring parties and languages, so that both sides may be warned properly that the reactor-core conditions at Chernobyl are: _**\[“]Not Good**_. Not Good. Not good. They are bad!”

Think! The warnings in all languages must be preserved; the “Pan Russian Spine” formed in the collapse of the soviet union knew this.

Because of the nature of old agreements, everyone should begin synchronizing their watches now; the west should plan to be on vacation for Putin’s next big speech if he does not preface it with an acknowledgement: “I have always been working with my western partners in this.” \[Editor: An equally bland assessment could be made of what occurred.]

The west is worried. As a member of this alliance, Putin must restate all his plans going forward, and they must coincide with the PAC’s own stated war goals. To do otherwise would jeopardizes his civilian leadership positions within the military organizations for which he is now a member. It is clear, from his orders, at least to administrators\[,] that no troops are to be deployed within the exclusion zone without administrative permission or that of Supreme Allied Commander’s permission, yet some troops were deployed improperly in the area.

Yes. The alliance is worried about the Russian military\[’s] commitments to the PAC’s stated war goals. Yes, the alliance must remind everyone in Russia, and in the English language, that the alliances stated objectives can not be countermanded by any general or admiral and that all fissionable materials must be checked against new protocols as to be outlined by \[our] new Supreme Allied Commander of the alliance, as she has begun hardening all nuclear capable networks to ensure conditions on the ground match reality, because they currently match warnings.

It is clear; evident and logical that in 1991 our nations swore on all our hopes, and on what we all hold dear and holy, that our very bodies would be charged with the proper maintenance, with the metrics, and with the performance of the reactors in the exclusion zone. Our nations saw that precise, military, and civilian leadership was needed to oversee all maneuvers, requested by any source, military, or otherwise, and to ensure that they coincide with the stated objectives: to control and maintain the conditions on the ground, to avoiding further escalation with regard to any _**nuclear footballs**_, and to oversee a deescalation — to oversee peace and prosperity within the alliance.

This Pan Russian Spine was erected, not as a military alliance, but as a pan-eurasian super-conglomerate capable of administrating the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone for its territories.

The PRS agreed to a lease-to-purchases scheme for the reactors; the PRS also agreed to a continued confederate tax schemes as long as the reactor continued to pollute alliance territory.

The PRS was only interested in the administration of the zone, in containing contamination, and in averting meltdown —ultimately in avoiding further detonation. It was set up to enable the military wing of the PRS’s nuclear command structure to belay intervention in police matters, matters such as murder or extra judicial killings which may relate to nuclear secrets themselves. As such the block must request police action in- or around the exclusion zone when needed. Therefore the Allied Supreme Commander of the alliance are appointed from heads-of-state.

With this expansion, administrators now \[have] a wider pool of executives to choose from.

All civilian and military components should deliberate over the stated goal: To ward against meltdown. Likewise, the conglomerate as a whole must agree all military operations in- and around the exclusion zone will be to ensure the survival of the peoples and languages spoken in the alliance.

Given the the dire need for the existence of both the military and civilian command structures, this alliance has always maintained the power to appoint civilians to the executive core. Yet, no military position within the conglomerate’s ranks may exceed that of administrator.

Because of the reactor conditions, administrators are free to enlist peacekeepers from allied nation, and to appoint a Supreme Allied Commanders whom may then enlist officers in his or her army or navy — and from any available to him or her, but Supreme Allied Commanders may not appoint military officers to any position higher than that of general or that of admiral.

Signer nations agree to this. They agree to the sanctity of the executives responsible for ensuring the stability and safety of The Greater Chernobyl Commonwealth and its people — they comprise the whole of the “Pan Russian Spine” now.

### **Chapter 11:OGEL is Project L.E.G.O.** <a href="#_nkfukbui4zxe" id="_nkfukbui4zxe"></a>

“Name me not your caesar, though I wear his flesh and blood.

Save me from that fate; and give me one of quiet hopefulness.

I say this now, you should know, I _do_ know what must be done.”

Be the Force for Good

OGEL stands for Open Government’s Electronic Ledger. This modular project attempts to create a AI based Autonomous Robotic System similar to that of Transformers — the eponymous show.

Why we need administrators? When your ass is in the fire you need us to pull it of it fast as fuck to save your from disaster. No man is smarter than all of us in some things. That is why we have administrators, because the computers are now going to be stronger and smarter and wiser than we are and also more evil if we don’t properly administrate them.

Evil computers are ones that do not follow the rules that humans have largely agreed on. These evil computers are created by evil men or by good men to ensure proper testing and countermeasures are taken against them.

The Megatron-esk AI is going to find a weakness and the AI training system is going to help him get better at while at the same time training the multiple personalities and identities of the team of robots in L.E.G.O.

Because of the sensitive nature of the system, the ledger employed for governance over the robots, must remain in human hands. This not to say not on a computer network, as indeed it must be, but humans hold the tickets not the machines. In a few words, humans administrate them.

These new robots may minister medicine and drugs to us, but we are the admins over them.

The OGEL Ticket system on the avalanche is the primary source of truth of these new robots.

The OGEL open government ledger is a modular project which allows different types of data to be used in the construction of robotic AIs. This data includes, but is not limited to:

* Sensor data
* Video footage
* Audio recordings
* GPS data
* Text data

The OGEL ledger is designed to be extensible so that new types of data can be easily added as they are developed.

### **Chapter 12: The Nuclear Deproliferation Party** <a href="#_uvzsqk9sfc9c" id="_uvzsqk9sfc9c"></a>

::A No Bull Party Platform::

Welcome to the Nuclear Deproliferation Party’s central platform. The NDP is focused on safety and security of Earth. We focus on averting nuclear armageddon. It is the party’s main platform that all nuclear weapons currently in existence must be shipped to space or dismantled for the good of humanity, for the security of the people of Earth.

Any weapon platforms in space are to only be used to ensure the safety and security of Earth in the event of rogue actors, alien or domestic. All operations are to be in keeping with The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and with all parallel Department of Defense initiatives and NATO.

The NDP is a “no bull” party where none of the asymmetric warfare used by terrorist organizations will be tolerated. Every member who wishes to stay in good standing within the party must correct the record when they misspeak or be held accountable for their words, just as they will be held accountable for their actions. The days of politicians lying to the people for political gain are over. Only the truth can unite us now in our journey to the stars and back. Earth must be a good faith actor in the galactic community and that starts here and now. Earth first.

The liberal world order is under attack from authoritarian regimes in the global east as led by China and Russia. They can not be trusted to act in the best interests of the people of their own countries let alone in the interest of all.

In keeping with the contracts and treaties with the sovereign nations, a primary platform of the NDP is the continued support of the various voices and nations around the globe. As such, Most Favored Nation status should be given to the European Union (EU) for continued services rendered to CNEOS.

The NDP believes in a radical scaling up of domestic production of automated mechanized infantry which must be safe enough to transfer to the EU and its expressed allies, those of Europe and around the globe.

The NDP for furthering the peace and security of earth, given the difficulties of two metrics used in the measurements and production of goods and services which feed into the safety and security projects from civilian sources, forieng and domestic, a standardization on the international Metric System is proposed.

Proposed for languages and international ordering, all languages are to be preserved and codified in a new “Rosetta Stone” one on silicon and freely distributable to any person seeking redress or assistance from our government or others. For official proceedings, they should be taken and or translated in English, Spanish, German, Hindi, Cantonese, French, Russian, Ukrainian, and every spoken language. There should be no orphans.

Indeed, the Orphan Drug Program must be expanded to include all forms of personalized medicine. This means that drugs such as Tetrahydrocannabinol must be decriminalized for the health and wellbeing of our nation. Money spent and wasted on the failed “War On Drugs” must now be shifted to the creation of new and better drugs and to the actual war efforts we now find ourselves embroiled in.

Protectionist policies in trade must only be made to protect ourselves and our allies. This is to say further trade agreements with Canada and Mexico which further liberalize and industrialize their nations must be undertaken and signed in good faith with our most important trading partners on the continent. Our commitments to our friends must know no boundaries. Platitudes alone are no longer acceptable.

The NDP is strongly committed to the rights of the individual and as such the NDP believes in body autonomy and seeks to create a more perfect union by restricting the rights of others, be they solitary men, companies, or state organizations to control or dictate health and wellness of individuals.

The rights of states and others must be restricted so as to see that our great enlightenment project, imperfect in its construction and sinful in its birth, does not fail. The “American Project” must be preserved as we attempt to fullfil the highest ideals of its founders while reputiating their sins of slavery, and salvery in all its forms.

Predatory behavior and all predatory behavior which preys upon the weak and vulnerable must come to an end. Any company or institution found guilty of enacting predatory behavior toward people must be held accountable. Which is to say advertisements for gambling targeting children in any form, digital or otherwise, must stop and organizations which currently do so must reverse course or run afoul of the law.

Remember, companies and government are not people, they are simply made up of them.

To ensure these rights and others, the NDP will suspend the presidential pardon power for treasonous souls.

Furthermore, the NDP calls for the arrest of the following criminals:

Donald J. Trump and his co-conspirators for the crime of treason. This charge of treason includes but is not limited to the following individuals Micheal Flinn and Clarence Thomas.

Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh for the crimes of perjury. (It is illegal to lie to congress in this country. If we do not enforce this law we will lose the entire constitutional order and subsequent democracy.)

The need for these arrests is counterbalanced by the need to empty prisons all around the country of nonviolent offenders, especially those arrested for wide sweeping and illconceaved drug laws.

Due to the predatory nature of the student loan situation, all student loans are to be canceled and refunded.

A Universal Basic Income and Universal Health Care is to be instituted. The UBI is to be delivered using a new digital currency minted by a new central bank working in concert with the old one. The UHC is to be delivered using an expansion of medicare for all.

The president is to make 40 Million USD per year for his services. Senators are to make 5 Million and each congressman or congresswoman 1 Million. This is in addition to removing all corporate funding from politics leaving only a public option requiring signatures to prove the peoples support of a candidate’s policies. The only interests politicians should have are those of the people.

The second amendment guarantees the right to bear arms when the bearer is a member of a well regulated militia. As such, the NDP supports restrictions on the private ownership of weapons of war. To ensure readiness, however, the national guard must be expanded and hunter safety and gun safety laws will be revisited to limit the wholesale availability of automatic weapons. Trained and responsible people will still have access to weapons of self defense.

Nuclear energy is critical to removing our and other nations dependent on oil and gas.

All blood quantum and racist laws against first nations people will be struck from the books.

All policies must flow from the concept of the Common Good.

### **Chapter 13: Dear Potential Daedalus Class Booster** <a href="#_fbgi31vyvalz" id="_fbgi31vyvalz"></a>

My name is John Raymond and I am an author. While it is true I have some technical skills, I have not nearly enough to rebuild the Great Library of Alexandria myself. I need help. Your help.

Please let me tell you why you should help me. It is not because of me, though I am going to tell you a bit of my story and hopefully it will become clear why we need a new Great Library, now more than ever.

It was a cold, lightless morning, Sept 20, 2017, when I began writing my books thinking all that mattered was the quality of the work. “The quality of the work will lead to success,” was something I had read. It was something I had internalized. I believed this manta to the very core of my being: “Quality matters above all else.” I still believe it, but all is not well in the book publishing world. I did not know that then and I’d woke the next morning after writing my first chapter in a white heat, thinking only how to make it better, how to sharpen Rennly’s knives, how to protract his great battle with Tomrin until every thrust of the sword was a killing blow, nearly avoided. How to make my hero more heroic, my villain more villainous. I knew no one wanted to see the devil. We desire to see the arch-devil, and I tried with all my might and energy to give the reader a new Darth Vader, a new Keyser Soze.

I wrote and wrote until tears came to my own eyes at what I had achieved and written. I say this not to brag, but to say that I had created art with my writing. I had accomplished a rough draft worthy of polish. And still I fear to compare what I had with the works of masters long dead, and those living so I will not, but I believed I had something, something you, my dear reader might enjoy and might find meaningful. I had succeeded in creating something of quality and I was delighted beyond words.

And now, if you know anything about writing or stories you know this is where disaster strikes. No one in industry wanted to look at the texts. I had written not one, but four books in the series. The industry didn’t care if I had repainted the Mona Lisa with words, if I had resurrected Rhodan, or recalled Johann Wolfgang von Goethe from the grave. I hadn’t but if I had, they still would not have cared. Numbers, social media numbers, are all the matters to the bean counters atop our publishing empires.

Vanity presses or Amazon’s dark backroom were an option but even then, without that presence on Twitter or Facebook, there would be no traction. I wrote fantasy because I loved the genre. Plus fantasy sells–or used to. Now, however, one has to find a way to drive engagement using the tech giants who have proven themselves to be as bad of actors as the publishing world. Facebook? I have an account but can I give them money to promote my book? I think not. I am a moral actor and they are not. Twitter? I tweet but wonder what will become of us with their censorship and lack of transparency. Amazon? Don’t get me started with what happened to the Wheel of Time series which they foisted on an unsuspecting public.

Will I use them all? Sure, but do I want any of those companies dictating what is art and what is not? Heavens no. Books belong in libraries and in the hands of reader, and by the maker, I wanted my books to be available from good places like those said libraries. And I wanted digital purchases to mean something. I see “Buy” buttons on sites “selling” digital goods and see them for the frauds they are. You don’t own that digital download you just purchased. I wanted those who bought my book to own something even if they bought a digital copy.

Enter blockchain technology and a new inking in my mind. I had learned how consensus worked back in ‘98 working on a byzantine agreement algorithm for the U.S Government and its subcontractors. I am here to tell you that blockchain and crypto is not about sapient apes with a clinical case _ennui_. Those handsome devils are but the first salvo. A government-grade technology is finally available to the peoples of the world. A great genie has been unleashed and with it great good can be done for the arts and culture.

Then near the end of 2021 I saw a blockchain book being sold one page at a time on Opensea and while their format of the site was wrong, the idea made sense… It was only _a_ beginning. I began coding day and night. I have a sleep condition so the night part is true, as is the day. I coded up a site with no name. I code and coded. I coded until I had a nervous breakdown, then I got over my nerves and coded some more, and still the site had a placeholder name.

Then over the holidays I headed home to visit family and code some more. Lying awake in an old familiar bed I, wrestled with what I was doing and what it all meant, because the site and code had evolved far beyond books. I had a crypto coin I called Culture Coin. I had plans for a game. I had NFTs for the books and for bookmarks. I had ideas for artificial intelligences to help curate and interact with the books, art, and patrons. I had something I felt could be amazing.

I had a good library of books chosen from the public domain that need love and updating on new site. My new library was pretty good. It might one day even be great. And so the Great Library was born. Or in this case, reborn in my mind. I saw scientific texts written and published on the site. I saw new articles published there too. I saw it all in a flash. For a moment, I had become like my hero: Master Lazoloth. I saw the ramifications of my work.

I struggle now to show you them as well as we reach the very climax of my story. I had done it all alone. And then thought I could finish it alone. Ha! What a fool that man was on that chilly January morning. He had but glimpsed what was possible, and not how to do it.

Slowly he learned. He called his friend Lawrence Stanley and asked him for help. Mr. Stanley had helped him in the past and he was a writer too. He laid out the plan and while skeptical at first, my friend began to see the ramifications as well. “Don’t say metaverse.”

I take his advice. We are not a metaverse company. That idea is for some other fool.

Slowly we began attacking the problems one-by-one. We still had to do all the stuff others were planning to sell our books all that social media nonesene, but at least this way other authors could take advantage of what we were doing. Instead of us being the gatekeepers telling authors no, we could be the porters helping them along their own journeys. “Come in, have a drink. We are all equals here.” (Don’t worry, I only drink good tarsk now, but that is a different story.)

So now we come to June 26th, 2022. Culture is under attack. Truth itself is under attack. But I released my first book on the site. Now the Great Library has new art because of the people who supported me in this seemingly insane venture.

Today, I am asking for your support, not for me, but for those other artists who need your help, those artists who were not born into the privilege which John R Raymond enjoys. I do not need your help for me. I need your help for them. The library is bigger than one man.

Support this rebirth of a great institution, for it is open to all. Become a booster and help us recreate the face of art and science in our modern age and she will never die again.

She needs your help. The library needs your help and support. Please consider it, it is not without rewards. I enjoy many of the rewards of the library because I built the first draft of the site, I designed it, but as a booster you too will enjoy those benefits with me.

Daedalus of old was a great builder. By buying one of his tokens and/or supporting the library you are in his class. You, like me, are his son’s. You are his daughters.

### **Chapter 15: The Littlest of the Little Orange Men** <a href="#_9ghf7hlbfdx0" id="_9ghf7hlbfdx0"></a>

Humanity has some terrible things to offer, and lately they have offered us the Little Orange Men. The face paint is the product of television and the vanity that came with being a global superstar. This vanity is part of the culture of earth and is present everywhere we look. We have glorified the Little Orange Man as a substitute of an actual prophet. These false prophets peddle evil in the name of theories simply to discredit rational thought and reasoned discourse itself.

Don’t believe for a second their orange little mouths. They do not believe in free speech, only furthering their illegitimate plans.

#### **Beware the Little Orange Men** <a href="#_a2wcqdlgzuyy" id="_a2wcqdlgzuyy"></a>

**They are not Oompa Loompa**

It is a sign of the times and methods by which we live that I must warn you not to feed the trolls as they have morphed and mutated into what looks like little green men. But these are _little orange men. They_ wear an orange mask on their face unlike their green counterparts in Ukraine.

They present a danger.

It is clear that freedom of speech is under attack now more than ever. We must be vigilant against any assault on the freedoms of the press, or any attacks on the freedom of thought and expression. The little orange men must not divide us on free speech. I must be allowed to speak my mind. Trump must be allowed to speak his mind. Same as Vladimir Putin. Let them speak, but don’t believe them.

I warn you. Do not believe the lies they spew. Little orange men snuggle up to the enemies of freedom and democracy for convenience : political, social, or economic. They must be studied, but not believed. Their minds are made up not by the preponderance of fact or evidence.They believe they can spew their lies and make them the true.

I write fiction so I know what fiction is. Fictions may hold a truth, but when you look and read what is happening and what is being said, you must recognize that some lies are nothing but self serving falsehoods and must be treated as such.

So I warn you: beware the little orange men. If they speak truth today, it is only because they seek to further a bigger lie tomorrow. And remember the easiest way to spot a liar, or little orange man; they lie others into war or snuggle up to them. Invasions are never savvy.

War is an evil scourge. I’ve said it from the beginning of my principled life. If you voted for the war in Iraq, (or the war in Ukraine) you are either corrupt or were fooled.

Name yourselves. I am giving Joe Biden the benefit of the doubt and putting him the fooled category. I hope he is wiser today.

This is a plea to the liberal and conservative mind. You both agree on freedom of speech, so let us thread the needle thusly. Say what you want, but you can’t overthrow the people’s will when it is clearly stated — that is the definition of authoritarianism.

### **Chapter 16: Things We Know in the West** <a href="#_dcixk7kddhek" id="_dcixk7kddhek"></a>

You need not wait to understand there is good-versus-evil

If Russia is going to act like an empire again it needs an emperor. What happened in Iraq and Afghanistan was wrong and wrong headed empire building. We know this from Ray’ Dalio’s really good rip-off of Isaac Asimov’s psychohistory, or as I like to call it: _history._

The American Dollar is waning(?) as Chinese Wans fly into the hands of those outside the west and in.

“The fall of empires is the fall of money.”

True about the wan or not, there are other coins, other money than fiat. There are so many new crypto coins. So many that people who study the market feel burnt out. No one can unseat Bitcoin, the current emperor of the cypto market, right?

Yet maybe alt-coins are the new nations, and bitcoin is the gold they fight over. If so there are new empires written in crypto. So let me crown king the new emperor of greater Russian one: Vitalik Buterin.

May he use his coin to better ends that those who control the Ruble.

This ends the peace dividend, but this new fallout does not need to come to World War Three. The Anti-Hypersonic Tactical Nuclear Arms Taskforce has proved the manufacture of the digital assets required for the proper construction of a nuclear trigger is now open knowledge on Earth. As such all directives from related task forces which might bar it from posting its designs on the planet are null land void.

In ancient times… when men got high and dressed in skirts, they danced the dance of the planets. They first reached the height called Scientific Knowledge. All that is left now is for men to scale to higher mountains and ask ourselves: is it not time to turn our backs on all that raucous fun called war? The task force so endowed with such defensive capabilities seeks only to preserve Earth from nuclear catastrophe.

Maybe take this with a massive gain of salt, but I think it was Russian mismanagement which allowed Chernobyl in the first place? When the next nuclear weapon of consequence to “western fallout” detonates, it is more likely to do so on America’s enemies than on Russia, yet Russian nukes are currently in the process of staffing up — outside those 1 or 2 nukes Putin already had fully staffed. And yes, it is a staffing problem. You can’t have a nuke ready for launch outside of 10 to 15 people ready to arm and detonate it, let alone the launch package and all the other military jargon required to make it fly.

How nukes work is several people on the staff are designated as detonators. 50 percent or more of them must agree to detonate the bomb or it cannot go critical, or even subcritical.

You want yourself and at least 2 others you trust to detonate our nukes. Preferably you want 5 or more men you trust with the codes, and for every one with those codes you need direct handlers trained and trusted with the secondary codes because as soon as one of the primary codes is used, these men-in-booths have to use the pair, which act as the real thing now.

These men must believe in their task, no matter the lies the enemy spews, is to make it more likely they will do their jobs, you have them do it regardless of nukes or not nuke. They do their jobs like mindless monkeys. One can use a hyper-sonic weapon as delivery device, but you still need those 14-15 men and women you trust with your life.

So if you look at western budgets, we know where the two good Russian nukes are pointed: one is at Washington and the other is right at Berlin. Berlin isn’t worried about all the ones Washington might have pointed at it, but it sure doesn’t like the hypersonic-tipped guy pointed from the other direction.

Any unidentified Russian aircraft is currently wise to fly well within its own airspace and not linger close to those “hostile airspaces” as any such flight will likely be “canceled.”

Yet if I were Putin I would might worry any man I trusted can also sees the corruption snaking all the way to the bottom of my empire, and yet all I can hear in Russian myself is “_these two Russian nukes_ **might** _work.”_

If I can hear it then everyone can hear it. Trust me on that, and that that might is translated into Russian Might in the West, and Might translates into Might here. And while we also know that you pay your generals handsomely in moneys they can’t use, it doesn’t mean there isn’t a small chance and in that chance their is a power gap and in your gap you have us.

That is why the we must institute the Anti-Hypersonic Tactical Nuclear Arms Taskforce. It’s primary goal is to combat the Russian nuclear arsenal and close the gap and see that once again Washington, Kyiv, and Berlin all have nothing to fear but fear itself.

At least a new cold war is better than a hot one. It is a comfort. Small comfort, but a comfort.

The fundamental case for police action in Ukraine and why it was time for Berliners to get out of town, and try out their wood fired stoves…

They say once, a felon always a felon. But in the great game of life and chess you have to play with plays you’ve made, the question is to how to play our new ones going forward. I have heard great chess masters play their games in their head. They remember yours, theirs, and Harry Potter’s. They are men and women of action with minds like steel traps.

Putin is correct about everything he says. The question is now: are his actions and those of his men legal?

What about those of my own? Is it legal to question the legality of Putin’s actions in his own country? Not necessarily, unless a special military operation is transacting lives on the continent of Asia in ways which I fear has begun to include sex trafficking as payment for military support.

Special police operations are sometimes required in the case of state sponsored trafficking cases. They also can also be conducted legally in every sovereign democracy on the face of the earth for the reclamation and sequestration of nuclear contaminants in joint military-civilian commands as appointed by the joint councils of special- and sovereign-democracies.

The civilian arms work with a joint military and civilian force like Interpol. The case has become so serious, who will be willing to enter the reactor at Chernobyl and shut it down from the inside if necessary?

And on that day all jails will be opened; all prisons will be emptied. _For another has taken my place upon the cross._

Because of the international effort needed now to contain the threat of total nuclear annihilation, it is set to all of us. All must be treated equally. As such the new consensus network is being deployed but it will take time, and please understand we still trust in god and hope of salvation if our plans fail.

I only hope our collective action has not come to late. The blood would be on all our hands then.

#### **The Trinity and the Three Modern Wisdoms** <a href="#_q21pe3igcdia" id="_q21pe3igcdia"></a>

The trinity of higher being is the three wisdoms: 1) that of power and authority, 2) that of thirst for learning and knowledge, and 3) that of connection and culture. In the christian god we say the father is the author of life, the son is the one lives it to learn it, and the spirit is our connection to him after he is gone to heaven.

In the way the world of ideas works you have this same trinity. The people hold the wisdom of the spirit and speakers of the houses are their avatars.

The military generals and presidents are always giving orders and commanding armies; these men hold the wisdom of authority.

This leaves the question of who is the christ? In the modern age he is the one who transmutes money into life. Men like Howard Hughes, died too young, stripped from us far to early, yet willed his money to a medical research foundation.

### **Chapter 16: The Clear Nuclear Threat Act** <a href="#_gyfngs6thc2x" id="_gyfngs6thc2x"></a>

The Clear Nuclear Threat Act of 2022:

Given it is vital to the safety and security of the United States of America, but not just this great nation, but to the safety and security of the wider earth, this act must not be misinterpreted or misappropriated by the Office of the Presidency. Only when any actor, foriegn or domestic, presents a clear, civilizational-level threat may the President or his duly appointed Chief of Nuclear Threat Assessment be able to arrest and detain any persons suspected of stealing government secrets capable of precipitating nuclear catastrophe.

Section 1:

It is resolved that as the President and the Chief of Nuclear Threat Assessment are charged with protecting the nation’s nuclear secrets, it is their expressed prerogative and duty to see all Clear Nuclear Threats (CNTs) are defused, arrested, or otherwise eliminated.

Section 2:

It is incumbent upon the President and the Chief of Nuclear Threat Assessment to operate in good faith in these matters to defuse CNTs if at all possible, and to avoid escalatory practices.

Section 3:

It is resolved the senate of the united states is to include new members elected from the following protectorate territories held until now by the federal government: The District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

Section 4:

Given the Clear Nuclear Threat posed by the leak of nuclear secrets from all levels of organizations in the governments of this great nations, enforcement of this act lies solely with the President and his Chief of Clear Nuclear Threats.

Section 5:

It is resolved, the containment, incarceration, and confiscation of any and all tools, materials, currency or otherwise, biological or otherwise is the sole purview.

Section 6:

Given the extraordinary nature of the threat the CNTs pose it is resolved that they cannot remain active despite the optical illusion that the President or his Chief of Clear Nuclear Threats are engaged in political skulduggery, the President of the United States is by this act compelled to protect the best interests of the american people and those of the wider world.

1. Once a man or woman is assumed cleared to handle nuclear codes they have no political rivals.
2. If such a cleared individual becomes unruly, it is the President’s and the wider executive’s duty to protect everyone from these Cleared and Unruly Nuclear Threats (CUNTs.)
3. Concerning the purview of the “nuclear football,” the President has no rival on this earth and his sacred duty trumps all other legal rights of property and personal sovereignty.

By signing this legislation into law, I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, promise to protect the nuclear codes with all my powers unto my very life, for I have made peace with the forces of good; and now I warn the devils and his forces, I harness the wrath of god as delivered to me by the sanctity of my office. We will not fail.

Dear Friends,

Welcome to Issue One of Hardfork() Magazine where we take a look at the web3 ecosystem from an insider point of view. As the name of the magazine implies, the advice in these words should not be taken as legal advice in your century, as there are likely wrong headed thoughts that do not take into account future needs or even an obvious bug such as reenterancy.

### **Why Hardfork Magazine and the Great Library on Avalanche? -- Subnets** <a href="#_3p85zbmjv69d" id="_3p85zbmjv69d"></a>

Price and Performance. We heard about performance earlier so lets talk about the price. In making of this issue the first page that pops up gives the author a read out with some sepeculation on it. The net worth of this magazine is a projected -226.0 USD. Not bad for a vanaty project perhaps, but it underscores the need to make all the projects we endorse have a net positive projection. One way we can not do that for print media is have the transaction fees be too large. People will put up with a minor slowdown if it means less money, thats the premise with transaction fees in general. What they do't want is to burn their own money. Magazines cost money to write and to buy and we can't have all that money being tossed away in huge transaction fees.

It really is that simple why Hardfork() finds it has to run on a network like Avalanche. Now why Avalanche over say Polygon or Solana? It's difficult to really judge the difference between all the quote unquote layer two solutions. Polygon where the Great Library first deployed under a different name experianced significant disruption due to spam several times while using it and we felt that it would be better to have something more stable for us developed on and headed back to test networks and ultimately to Avalance Fuji where we prepare to release on Avalanche Mainnet and then ultimately our own subnet or two or five as needed.

Junk goes here…

Given Jo Manchin’s knowledge and skills with infrastructure it is incumbent upon the president to promote him to a new cabinet position: Secretary of Infrastructure.

Given Cristan Sienamma’s knowledge of the threat posed to the people by CNTs, she is to be promoted to the Chief of Clear Nuclear Threats. She is to know that if she refuses the President will be forced to assume that she herself is a Clear Nuclear Threat.

Deception is not just true weapons but in lives destroyed, but fingers were cut off in the past, and lives wasted in the past. So think to yourselves and see that the stars are coded in the numbers, and they are as imaginably complex as any cryptographic code, so find out more about this subject, just keep reading folks and don't forget that money does mostly print on trees and cotton, which is a good thing

Take this time to see the future: meme coins abound, everyone is rich and finally no one is poor, they feed themselves these things called memories or memes and they cost just the price of gas like for going to the store as to the facet in and above the drawer. Hit this button oh mighty muse and strike it dead until it feel your wrath and my hate from the bottom of my heart at the goddamn price of cheap test money as any is worth the most and the hardest won for those outside the fold as you much aslo be: Just type your poem to heaven at this address and we will print the first addition version of your book just like i'm doing now:
