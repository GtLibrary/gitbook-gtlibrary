Dear Potential Daedalus Class Booster,

My name is John Raymond and I am an author. While it is true I have some technical skills, I have not nearly enough to rebuild the Great Library of Alexandria myself. I need help. Your help.

Please let me tell you why you should help me. It is not because of me, though I am going to tell you a bit of my story and hopefully it will become clear why we need a new Great Library, now more than ever.

It was a cold, lightless morning, Sept 20, 2017, when I began writing my books thinking all that mattered was the quality of the work. “The quality of the work will lead to success,” was something I had read. It was something I had internalized. I believed this manta to the very core of my being: “Quality matters above all else.” I still believe it, but all is not well in the book publishing world. I did not know that then and I’d woke the next morning after writing my first chapter in a white heat, thinking only how to make it better, how to sharpen Rennly’s knives, how to protract his great battle with Tomrin until every thrust of the sword was a killing blow, nearly avoided. How to make my hero more heroic, my villain more villainous. I knew no one wanted to see the devil. We desire to see the arch-devil, and I tried with all my might and energy to give the reader a new Darth Vader, a new Keyser Soze.

I wrote and wrote until tears came to my own eyes at what I had achieved and written. I say this not to brag, but to say that I had created art with my writing. I had accomplished a rough draft worthy of polish. And still I fear to compare what I had with the works of masters long dead, and those living so I will not, but I believed I had something, something you, my dear reader might enjoy and might find meaningful. I had succeeded in creating something of quality and I was delighted beyond words.

And now, if you know anything about writing or stories you know this is where disaster strikes. No one in industry wanted to look at the texts. I had written not one, but four books in the series. The industry didn’t care if I had repainted the Mona Lisa with words, if I had resurrected Rhodan, or recalled Johann Wolfgang von Goethe from the grave. I hadn’t but if I had, they still would not have cared. Numbers, social media numbers, are all the matters to the bean counters atop our publishing empires.

Vanity presses or Amazon’s dark backroom were an option but even then, without that presence on Twitter or Facebook, there would be no traction. I wrote fantasy because I loved the genre. Plus fantasy sells–or used to. Now, however, one has to find a way to drive engagement using the tech giants who have proven themselves to be as bad of actors as the publishing world. Facebook? I have an account but can I give them money to promote my book? I think not. I am a moral actor and they are not. Twitter? I tweet but wonder what will become of us with their censorship and lack of transparency. Amazon? Don’t get me started with what happened to the Wheel of Time series which they foisted on an unsuspecting public.

Will I use them all? Sure, but do I want any of those companies dictating what is art and what is not? Heavens no. Books belong in libraries and in the hands of reader, and by the maker, I wanted my books to be available from good places like those said libraries. And I wanted digital purchases to mean something. I see “Buy” buttons on sites “selling” digital goods and see them for the frauds they are. You don’t own that digital download you just purchased. I wanted those who bought my book to own something even if they bought a digital copy.

Enter blockchain technology and a new inking in my mind. I had learned how consensus worked back in ‘98 working on a byzantine agreement algorithm for the U.S Government and its subcontractors. I am here to tell you that blockchain and crypto is not about sapient apes with a clinical case _ennui_. Those handsome devils are but the first salvo. A government-grade technology is finally available to the peoples of the world. A great genie has been unleashed and with it great good can be done for the arts and culture.

Then near the end of 2021 I saw a blockchain book being sold one page at a time on Opensea and while their format of the site was wrong, the idea made sense… It was only _a_ beginning. I began coding day and night. I have a sleep condition so the night part is true, as is the day. I coded up a site with no name. I code and coded. I coded until I had a nervous breakdown, then I got over my nerves and coded some more, and still the site had a placeholder name.

Then over the holidays I headed home to visit family and code some more. Lying awake in an old familiar bed I, wrestled with what I was doing and what it all meant, because the site and code had evolved far beyond books. I had a crypto coin I called Culture Coin. I had plans for a game. I had NFTs for the books and for bookmarks. I had ideas for artificial intelligences to help curate and interact with the books, art, and patrons. I had something I felt could be amazing.

I had a good library of books chosen from the public domain that need love and updating on new site. My new library was pretty good. It might one day even be great. And so the Great Library was born. Or in this case, reborn in my mind. I saw scientific texts written and published on the site. I saw new articles published there too. I saw it all in a flash. For a moment, I had become like my hero: Master Lazoloth. I saw the ramifications of my work.

I struggle now to show you them as well as we reach the very climax of my story. I had done it all alone. And then thought I could finish it alone. Ha! What a fool that man was on that chilly January morning. He had but glimpsed what was possible, and not how to do it.

Slowly he learned. He called his friend Lawrence Stanley and asked him for help. Mr. Stanley had helped him in the past and he was a writer too. He laid out the plan and while skeptical at first, my friend began to see the ramifications as well. “Don’t say metaverse.”

I take his advice. We are not a metaverse company. That idea is for some other fool.

Slowly we began attacking the problems one-by-one. We still had to do all the stuff others were planning to sell our books all that social media nonesene, but at least this way other authors could take advantage of what we were doing. Instead of us being the gatekeepers telling authors no, we could be the porters helping them along their own journeys. “Come in, have a drink. We are all equals here.” (Don’t worry, I only drink good tarsk now, but that is a different story.)

So now we come to June 26th, 2022. Culture is under attack. Truth itself is under attack. But I released my first book on the site. Now the Great Library has new art because of the people who supported me in this seemingly insane venture.

Today, I am asking for your support, not for me, but for those other artists who need your help, those artists who were not born into the privilege which John R Raymond enjoys. I do not need your help for me. I need your help for them. The library is bigger than one man.

Support this rebirth of a great institution, for it is open to all. Become a booster and help us recreate the face of art and science in our modern age and she will never die again.

She needs your help. The library needs your help and support. Please consider it, it is not without rewards. I enjoy many of the rewards of the library because I built the first draft of the site, I designed it, but as a booster you too will enjoy those benefits with me.

Daedalus of old was a great builder. By buying one of his tokens and/or supporting the library you are in his class. You, like me, are his son’s. You are his daughters.

Head Librarian and author of _The Scarab Cycle_,

John R Raymond
