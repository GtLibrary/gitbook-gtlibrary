# The Great Library’s Requirements

The Great Library’s Requirements

::With Pitch Deck::

Welcome adventurer, you are not lost if you are interested in Web3/Game-Fi. In keeping with the Great Library’s mission to be open and transparent, here you will find documentation and information you need to understand the coin, the site, and game-fi offering _The Scarab Cycle._

Good games have two things: good game play loop and a good story. The game document is primarily focused on the game play loop. The story comes from the books.

The Great Library is pleased to introduce the next evolution of the written word. By blending artistic content, NFT’s, gaming, and AI, we leap past the current saturated e-reader market and bring something new. We marry the best of physical mediums with the ease of digital ones.

The humble book is physical, tactile, and collectible. A large library is the sign of culture to some. It can speak to one's passions and interests. Books can take us to far away places. They teach us things we never thought were possible. They are, sadly, cumbersome, entirely static, and, once read, collect dust. But most damaging, there is a significant barrier to entry which barres all but the most easily marketable of new authors. Even they have a steep hill to climb. To enter this tight market, as the cost to print, to store and to distribute and market physical media is high, publishers face an increasingly cluttered market and fear to innovate.

E-Books tried to address this shortcoming, but have shortcomings of their own. Gone is the collectability, and the book is still static and unchanging. Barriers to entry are lessened to an extent that now virtually anyone can publish their _tome_. And yet in a saturated market it is even more difficult and expensive to expose a new book to potential buyers. Some authors are experimenting with the Patreon system in an effort to serialize their writing and give their fans early access in an effort to generate income, but this has met limited success for the little guys.

Smartbooks should be radically different. They make books collectable again. They are also dynamic, and capitalizing on being a digital medium. Crypto drives the story of publishing to hitherto unreached markets. NFT tokens generated from the work proves exclusive ownership of a piece of the art, using the secure backbone of the crypto blockchain networks. One can buy and sell on the integrated marketplace with other avid collectors and fans. Authors can be automatically granted a portion of current and future resales through the blockchain. The app gives access to readers using crypto capable devices. While for the authors, the AI tools help guide their success. In total, the sale of bookmarks, embedded games, and even advertisements will generate revenue, excitement, and a chance to use Culture Coin. There is almost no limit to the possible content. Think artwork, AI pets, exclusive author access, audiobooks and even the distribution of limited edition physical media–the old fashioned printed book.

Crypto gives the digital version of the book life in the library.

### But Why _The Great Library_? <a href="#_yj99d54a1qs" id="_yj99d54a1qs"></a>

We look back on the wonders of the ancient world and wonder: _how it could all come to ruin?_ Are we at some inflection point in history now, like before the bronze age collapse? Will others wonder why we used our modern wonders to destroy ourselves?

We can not afford to let the barbarians sack the libraries ever again. The Great Library’s singular mission is to shed light on ignorance, in its many forms. As civilization across the globe hangs in the balance, libraries have sought to pump wonder into the hearts and minds of all who breathe free air. At the library you will see the dead are not gone; they are not forgotten.

### Why _The Great Library_, Really? <a href="#_o06vrdk3hz9o" id="_o06vrdk3hz9o"></a>

Web3-enabled 3D genre games is the answer. Written in Unity, these are original game titles created specially for titles in the library. The first title is _The Scarab Cycle. It is_ an action role playing game (ARPG) based on the series written by John R Ryamond. The second title is _The Runners_, an ARPG based on the series written by Lawrence Stanley.

Putative new titles include: _Green Enterprise,_ the working title for a space adventure game based on an updated physics engine. The story is a collaboration between John R Raymond and Lawrence Stanley.

### Why Culture Coin? <a href="#_s454xflm3sqv" id="_s454xflm3sqv"></a>

Culture Coin plays the role of library token similar to the arcade token. But unlike arcade tokens which have poor “tokenomics,” the Culture Coin was written to have strong tokenomics without the instabilities of other stable coins.

### What Makes Culture Coin’s Tokenomics So Stellar? <a href="#_lvs5wp84igto" id="_lvs5wp84igto"></a>

There are only a set number of Culture Coins ever minted. Some are being held by the administrators, but most are brought into circulation by the community using the ICO and dexes. The token’s internal dex has the unique property that any CC returned will automatically be burned. This means the token is strictly deflationary.

Culture Coin’s primary function is as a gas token—its primary role is to be burned for products and services, like for casting spells in the games—leaving those left in circulation worth more.

### Why Stake Your Culture Coin? <a href="#_otmedcgu2czl" id="_otmedcgu2czl"></a>

Staking allows holders of Culture Coin to burn their CC for an interest plus principal payment later. (The staking protocol is built directly into the token’s underlying smart contract and is another way in which the coin facilitates burning as any staked CC is burned.)

### Getting Started – Time Is Valuable <a href="#_sn2rsxwv3udl" id="_sn2rsxwv3udl"></a>

Books in the great library have underlying smart contracts–more than one, but the ones we are most interested in for the game are the bookmarks as they are like owning property in the game Monopoly, or even like property in real-life.

Let’s talk about the _Scarab Cycle_ game… It depends on bookmarks for guild-based profit sharing and as such each hero minted in the game is minted from a bookmark and the owners of the bookmarks take a small cut of the revenues when the items are sold on the in-game auction house.

This is not a free to play game but it is a cheap to play game that interacts with the library’s token: Culture Coin. Culture Coin is not here to confuse players into microtransaction or into a gatcha loop. It is only here to empower the Game-Fi aspects of the underlying library systems. Items players create using the mechanisms of the game have real-money implications and in no way do the game creators wish to hide this fact through balkanized mechanisms.

The take-away is this. If you play this game and wish to make money at it we support that. Want to sell your hero? We support that. By playing the game you gain ownership of valuable in-game assets–as it should be.

Remember, your time is valuable.

### Planned Features <a href="#_ghd3cjassv24" id="_ghd3cjassv24"></a>

Legendary item effects

Item crafting

In-game auction house

User contributed cosmetics and art

### Commitment to the players <a href="#_tfmy5mymaxn6" id="_tfmy5mymaxn6"></a>

We want a game in which money can play a part without it becoming evil. Players should be able to sell their characters, unlike in World of Warcraft. People without large disposable incomes should not be farmed by “whales.” No loot boxes. Never ever. Any gambling on the site must be based on knowledge/skill. And no predatory sales will ever be allowed. This is **NOT** diablo immortal.

### Threading the Needle of Pay-to-Win <a href="#_i7m5qymt87yr" id="_i7m5qymt87yr"></a>

For this version of the game the library’s token Culture Coin will play a role in the availability of loot and the purchase thereof. That means that aspects of the game will be pay-to-win. Therefore it is imperative we thread the needle and not fall into the traps other pay-to-win games fall into.

First off, the library’s token is the primary in-game currency. Heroes are minted with it, and items are bought and sold with it. It is the hope that the bookmarks heroes are minted from confer some advantage, or lack thereof, given that bookmarks are a property which is ownable. Ownership must confer some privilege, and in this “needle threading” they will.

First off the amount of reward gas locked in a bookmark will impact the quantity of loot available to the heroes minted from the bookmark. If a bookmark has no locked Culture Coin the bookmark for a scene only confers the scene level loot boost, say a 5% greater amount of loot from a mob killed within the scene for the heroes of the scene.

For example take scene one where Gaz is the main lootable mob. If your hero is minted from the bookmark for scene one, then when you loot Gaz with your hero you will receive 105 Gaz ERC1155 tokens as loot, not the standard 100 of other heroes from all the other bookmarks.

However if Culture Coin has been locked into bookmark then the amount may be higher based on the following calculation: percent bonus is equal to the logarithm of CultureCoin divided by the normalization constant for the game. This constant is something like six or seven so that the locked Culture Coin bonus is effectively never greater than around 5%. So in the best case for a hero their bonus from killing Gaz may be as high as 10% more of the loot for killing and looting him.

So called “whales” should not have player power outrageously greater than people who do not have large sums of Culture Coin to throw away. Which brings us to our core philosophy.

### The Library’s Philosophy on Games and Gaming <a href="#_h2vcx24stii0" id="_h2vcx24stii0"></a>

All games have issues which detract from the fun and while the library’s games will be no different, we strive to make any unfortunate aspects as innocuous as possible. We have a philosophy and it is that players should be able to enjoy all the content the game has to offer while by the time they reach 80% of the effective max power.

#### The 80-20 rule <a href="#_81tqp92qa4lv" id="_81tqp92qa4lv"></a>

The 80-20 rule is a critical rule for understanding the library’s philosophy. The rule can be applied to many aspects of the game. Whales should never be able to get 20% more powerful than a minnow.

#### No theft from the players <a href="#_wih3icmme3y0" id="_wih3icmme3y0"></a>

In Diablo II (D2) and Path of Exile (PoE) if you die in the late game the game steals money and experience from you. This theft does not add anything to the game save to make it harder. It acts as a gatekeeper. But more importantly, it robs the player of fun. Also in D2, socketing a gem locks it in place and it cannot be removed without destroying it. Such destructive behavior from the game when it is not needed is also a form of theft.

If the game needs to burn tokens for economic reasons, then that process must be coded specifically to the problem and must give the player compensation in return. Having to nuke a gem or rune to replace it is not acceptable. Scrapping them to upgrade something is much better.

#### Caps are the enemy of flow <a href="#_n7gezkc0kwcr" id="_n7gezkc0kwcr"></a>

The best games allow the player to enter a state of mind known as flow, and only breaks them out of flow when they fail to achieve an objective or when they succeed. This means that if the player sets out to do something, in the best world that thing they wish to do should be doable for as long as they wish it.

Therefore there should not be any caps to any activities. Such game design is coded to abuse the player into logging in everyday to do chores and the like. This is a big no no.

#### Events are better than dailies <a href="#_rs81yaf8wldz" id="_rs81yaf8wldz"></a>

The use of events to entice people to play is much better than giving players daily chores in game.

#### No abusive gambling <a href="#_cauc1p8gxanp" id="_cauc1p8gxanp"></a>

Life is a gamble. Everything we do is a gamble. But that doesn’t mean we should be addicted to gambling. Any gamble made in the game must be tied to skill, knowledge, or foresight. Loot boxes are right out.

#### No parasitic design <a href="#_k2f3tvdynq7y" id="_k2f3tvdynq7y"></a>

All features should be synergistic. But what does that mean? It means that bolt-on systems are not allowed in the games. Movement is a synergistic design pattern in most RPGs. If you need to hit something out in the world with your staff, then you probably need to move to it.

If you are swinging your staff then having different swing timers is synergistic with the attack mode in question. However, once a game is made, adding on soulbinds like seen in World of Warcraft (WoW) do nothing but detract from the game. The same goes for outfitting pets and helpers like in Diablo III (d3.) Such systems detract from the game because they create unnecessary worry in the minds of the players. Instead of worrying about themselves and their friends they are worried about an NPC. This does nothing but make the game more complex without adding any real additional fun.

If the player has to have a helper, it is up to the game to outfit and supply the helper.

### Understanding Bookmarks Better <a href="#_2pj14mecjsf6" id="_2pj14mecjsf6"></a>

The text of a book is marked up to include section breaks. Each section is analogous to these bookmarks. On the site inside the html for the books a smart contract for the bookmarks supplies the ERC721 tokens that line up with these bookmarks/sections.

### Benefits of Ownership <a href="#_mcd5y44y7d05" id="_mcd5y44y7d05"></a>

They are critical to the game function as well as for petting BEN and other gambling mechanics on the site.

#### Gambling on Bookmarks <a href="#_hlgqah604tbz" id="_hlgqah604tbz"></a>

The gamble will not be one that is based on pure luck. One must be able to predicate the future or have some skill to win.

#### Petting BEN <a href="#_u4cl2lg41s8v" id="_u4cl2lg41s8v"></a>

Petting BEN is initially a way to interact with the AI custodian for the library. BEN is the friendly cat who likes to wander the digital stacks.

### Movement and Camera Controls in Game <a href="#_v8bjrq4zgdfo" id="_v8bjrq4zgdfo"></a>

Because the UI of any game is so critical, a theory of how it should work is important. Largely this game is inspired by the likes of Path of Exile (PoE) and World of Warcraft (WoW.) Because of the speed of the game and the need to target the spells and abilities, the WoWmodel of movement and camera control is what we are shooting for.

Clicking both mouse buttons will cause the player to move forward and then WASD can help modify those movements.

Targeting will require selecting the mobs individually at the start and possibly a location at some point for area of effect spells and abilities.

### The Full Requirements: OxFxM <a href="#_190fyavfn2x3" id="_190fyavfn2x3"></a>

Pronounced “Oh, cross Eff, cross Em,” the OxFxM model of requirements traceability is what this project uses for its main high level design and will include all of the great library. Operations are the highest level actions that users and AIs can take. Whereas the functionalities implement large swaths of these operations. The module level is the lowest level and is at the function or subroutine level of the code.

### Operations <a href="#_cyxvbp1x5t6j" id="_cyxvbp1x5t6j"></a>

Welcome the high level operations that users can accomplish when using the software you are writing. These are the “Steve Jobs Level” concepts. These are what he worried about when he made his code. Is the user experience clean and consistent across all the operations the users partake in? At the highest level we do not worry about what functionalities are needed to implement, we simply assign them the functionalities needed to accomplish the goal and as we work through the operations we worry about the UX (user experience.)

Based on myPrompt BEN is to generate a text response using a GPT to provide an in-character response that follows from the prompt.

### A Case Study: Scene One <a href="#_888655jwb6ny" id="_888655jwb6ny"></a>

The users currently have to sign all their actions on chain but we will allow a bridge to remove that in the future. So say player1 zones into scene one:

1. GAZ and RENNLY are fighting
2. GAZ is an enemy NPC
3. GAZ has 50 hp
4. Player1 cast Druidfire by running the contract function: BaseLoot.sol::castDF()
5. The transaction kills GAZ
6. Player1 loots GAZ by calling: BaseLoot.sol::loot()

What this means in Unity is the user selects GAZ and pressed the 1 key which is mapped to “Druidfire” let’s say. So the unity CS code calls userPressed1Key(). Then inside that function it determines there is a mapping to Druidfire for key 1 and that the user wants to cast Druidfire.

So now inside userPressed1Key() a new function is called: doDruidFireForUser()

This function will call a contract function castDF() which requires the user to sign the tx using metamask or some wallet.

In the future, however, doDruidFireForUser() can call into bridging code on the cloud that will call castFD() on behalf of the user so they do not have to sign the transaction themselves.

This new bridging ability will likely happen when we move to our own Avalanche Subnet.

### Loot and the “Cube” <a href="#_5sgwb5e2uci" id="_5sgwb5e2uci"></a>

TimeCube.sol was inspired by the great ether-monster in the sky. But what is it for? It is for controlling many aspects of the game, but primarily, users will use “the cube” to transmute the loot they get off of monsters and mobs in the game to create items: ERC721 items to be specific.

### A quick rundown of how loot works <a href="#_j3dz6on7501b" id="_j3dz6on7501b"></a>

When a lootable NPC dies, players calling the BaseLoot.sol:loot() contract function cause a mint of a new ERC1155 with the hero token id of the dead mob as its identifier. This ERC1155 is transferred to the msg.sender, AKA the player’s wallet.

Then the user has to call TimeCube.sol::transmute() to convert the ERC1155 to the ERC721 which is the item. Many pieces of loot may be required to create the best items in the game. So 1, 2, 3 or even 20+ ERC1155 loot tokens may be necessary to craft the best legendary items.

### Beyond Game-Fi <a href="#_pojca0sh9sc2" id="_pojca0sh9sc2"></a>

Maybe you aren’t a game developer but still want to contribute? We need to make the e-reader for the Great Library’s smart-books and a total reskin of the site. Skills include JS, REACT, PYTHON, WEB3 and many more. We are looking for people who are just starting their WEB3 journey as well as old hands at software development.
