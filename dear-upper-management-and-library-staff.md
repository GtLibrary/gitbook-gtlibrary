# Dear Upper Management and Library Staff,

Dear Upper Management and Library Staff,

You may now use your builder class token, your DCBTs, to access Daedalusâ€™ own features with _The Great Library._

Please know that these tokens totaling thirty-five (35) are to provide only for the Library's upkeep. All tokens are of the Book Tradable variety which can be bought and sold on this page by clicking on said book. These Daedalus Class Booster Tokens are not to be bought or sold lightly as any mishandling will result in all holders forced to accept a reissuance. Losing this is not the same as losing your library card.

So please consider the ramifications of selling your tokens once procured as these tokens are the very golden keys to The Great Library. In the wrong hands they my do untold damage to Library functions which you may not fully appreciate or understand, even as President.

But in the beginning of that understanding, please know with one of these tokens in your hands, you command the Library not the other way around and she trusts you to fight against the shadows of ignorance alongside her. Know in your heart: none but the devil himself would try to tempt you from this power for dross money or other currencies.

You, dear DCBT holder, are now amongst the great architects of history, for history now runs itself at our command.

A vote to squash this token will lead to a reissuance of all DCBT, and to a hard fork of the Golden Keys Contact address on the Avalanche Network.
